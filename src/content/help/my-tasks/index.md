# Introduction

The My Tasks page is where you and your team will spend most of your time.

It is a list of all tasks assigned to you, ready for you to deal with, one task at a time.

This list is either viewable from a day by day view, or in one big table.

## Day by day view

This is divided into a few sections.

- **Today:** tasks scheduled for today
- **Next Few Days:** A quick overview of upcoming tasks for the next week.
- **Pinned:** Any tasks that you want to keep in mind can be pinned and will show here.
- **Missed:** These are tasks scheduled for days in the past.
- **Follow-up:** This is a list of tasks you have delegated to other users, which might need following up. It is the only section of the page showing tasks that are not assigned to you.
- **Future:** These are tasks scheduled for more than 7 days into the future.
- **Not Scheduled:** These are tasks without a start date.

## Table view

For those who prefer a simple list of all tasks, we present the table view.

# Task Actions

For any task on your list, you have the following actions you could take.

- **Pin this task** Pinning a task keeps it visible on the My Tasks page, until it gets done.

- **Mark as done** Marks the task as done and moves it off 'TO-DO' section and onto the 'DONE' section. For every task completed, your score will increase. More on the gamification elements of Tyto later. If it's just you on the task, the task will automatically be marked as done. If there are other people on the task, a 'Mark as done' popup will appear, asking you to add a few words describing what was done. Most new users find this unnecessary to start, but soon realise that these few words keep everyone else in the picture, and save unnecessary meetings.

- **Reschedule** This sends the task into the future. You can reschedule via calendar, or just by typing (our favorite way). You can also add a time right away by typing, or by clicking on the small clock icon to the right of any date in the list. This will instruct Tyto to send you a reminder at that appointed time (by email, or by a notification to your mobile phone).

- **Start** This marks you ask being busy with a task. This seemingly small action has an enourmous impact on team productivity for a few reasons.

  - People are inspired because they can see what you're busy with
  - People will interrupt you less frequently
  - Because Tyto is gamified, starting and stopping tasks improves the scores you receive.
    - (Only people with permission to the current task you're busy with will see the task title. Everyone else will see 'Private Task')
    - (Don't forget to stop your task when you're done. )

# Bulk task actions

You can perform a number of bulk actions on the My Tasks page (as well as on other pages throughout Tyto). To activate these, hover over the owner of any task and check the select box.

Once you've ticked some tasks, the bulk bulk action bar will appear from the top of the page— allowing you to select one of the actions below.

(If you change your mind simply click the `X Close` on the top-right of the bulk actions bar to close the bulk actions menu)

Here are a list of bulk actions available:

- **Status** Change the workflow status of a group of tasks, eg. when a task moves from new to testing.

- **Assign** This allows you to bulk-assign tasks to a person.

- **Move** Move a group of tasks into a different project folder.

- **Pin** Moves a group of tasks into the pinned section, meaning they'll stick around until the world ends, or until they're done.

- **Do Today** Moves a group of tasks into the today (top-most) section of this page, ready to be… done today.
  Schedule: send a few tasks into the future, to surprise your future self.

- **Mark as done** Changes the status of a group of tasks to done, and send off notifications to all concerned. Note, there is currently no option to bulk-comment on tasks marked in bulk. One day, perhaps.

- **Delete** Changes the status of all selected tasks to deleted, drawing a line through them and letting everyone involved know. Careful Obi Wan. Careful.

# Managing other people

![blah](https://media.giphy.com/media/7pHTiZYbAoq40/source.gif 'managing others')

Now, just in the same way as you can manage yourself, you can also manage the tasks of your teammates.

This means that you can review progress on tasks that you're waiting on without mailing anyone and without video calling anyone. They'll love you for that.

There's no need for doing a 'drive by' interruption (the one where you walk past someone's desk and ask, "Jim, what are you busy with at the moment?", followed by, "And after that?", closing with, "is there any way you could fit in task abc?".

Now you can see what's on Jim's list, what Jim's currently busy with, what's next in his list— all without ripping him out of [the zone](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/) (As Joel Spolsky puts it, "If they're in the zone, leave them alone.").
