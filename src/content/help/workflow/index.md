# Introduction

Our workflow feature is really good at helping your team get better at tasks they do regularly, allowing you to break these tasks into steps, to add intelligence and information to each of these steps.

Take for example a panelbeater. In order for a car to get fixed, it will move through a series of steps. Here is a detailed list of what might be involved in such a process.

- towing
- quoting
- quote acceptance
- parts list
- panelbeating
- spraying
- quality checks
- insurance submission
- notifiy customer of estimated completion
- customer sign off
- invoice customer
- customer payment
- customer takes car

For a small company, the tasks above might be done by one or 2 people, but as the company grows, various steps might be completed by different team members.

This is where the workflow comes in handy.

Rather than having to create subtasks for each of these steps, the workflow feature allows us to move each car through the above steps.

As a task gets to a certain step, it will automatically be assigned to the correct team member. That team member will see which step the car is on, together with instructions on what to do to complete that step.

Take for example the 'quote acceptance' step. It may require a few pieces of information to be gathered before sending off the quote, for example, 'name', 'email address' and 'telephone number'.

We put these into a checklist as part of the quote acceptance step and your team member will see something like the following:

``
Step 3: quote acceptance
Gather all the following information before sending off the quote.

- [ ] Customer Name
- [ ] Email Address
- [ ] Telephone Number
- [ ] Registration Number
- [ ] Insurance Company
- [ ] Insurance Number
      ``

Now, regardless of which team member is doing this step, they will have clear information about what is required. This will ensure consistency for every step of the car repair experience, as well as being helpful for training new or stand

Forgive the lengthy example, but the workflow feature is an advanced concept. We offer a weekly webinar for anyone wanting to learn a bit more about this feature.
