## Why we built Tyto

We know that your small business doesn't need yet another thing to get in the way of your daily work.

But, if your small business feels like an endless decathlon between email, meetings, texts, calendar, spreadsheets, Slack, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype, Trello and Jira, you'll understand why we built Tyto.

Rewinding to 2014. We had built a solid business to business integration platform, and had started to attracted top clients, but were struggling to grow from a small to a medium business.

We tried one project management system after the next, but the team hated each one, saying they were slowing them down. We wanted to take on more staff, but didn't want to lose the meticulous quality of work we had become known for. We had tried employing top project managers, with very little to show for it. We were stuck.

## Some of the problems we were facing

- Having to jump around multiple systems to update, find, track and complete work.
- No idea of what the rest of the team are doing.
- Ending up in a deluge of client progress meetings.
- Any systems we tried were abandoned by either our team, or clients within a few weeks.- Updating multiple spreadsheets for clients and team leaders.
- So many meetings and emails.

## The Solution

Tyto was built to be the smallest system it could be.
