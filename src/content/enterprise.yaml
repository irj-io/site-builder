      - title: Sounds too good to be true. How do you do this?
        content: Firstly, Tyto has a very powerful task API for all the regular integrations you could imagine. But for the multi-system, multi-client, extra complex workflows, we make use M2North, our sister companyâ€”Â who have been the glue to over 35,000 of the biggest (and smallest) companies for the last 19 years.
      - title: Sounds expensive. How much does this cost?
        content: You'd be surprised how affordable these integrations are. Our goal is to provide real-world solutions for companies. We charge a monthly subscription fee for the enterprise integration.
      - title: Sounds painful. How long does a typical integration take?
        content: A typical integration takes no more than a few weeks to get up-and-running, with a complete, robust solution taking 1-2 months.
      - title: Which systems do you integrate with?
        content: SAP, Baan, JD Edwards, as well as many fully bespoke solutions. We integrate via a long list of methods, including SOAP, API, FTP, SFTP, email, SQL (via staging servers) and even via a fully-configurable on-site custom collector.
